\section{Basic suggestions going forward}

\begin{frame}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{./lecture_includes/analisa.jpg}
\end{center}

\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item Basic principles -- DiD calculation, ATT, parallel trends, falsifications, event studies
\item Covariates -- Abadie, Sant'Anna and Zhao
\item Differential timing with heterogeneity -- Bacon, Callaway and Sant'anna, Sun and Abraham, Borusyak, et al., Gardner, Wooldridge
\item Continuous treatments -- Callaway, Sant'anna and Goodman-Bacon
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Concluding remarks on DD}

\begin{itemize} 
\item You're probably going to write a paper using DiD at least once in your life, but probably more
\item Even if you don't, you're going to read a lot of papers using DiD, referee them, or advise students using them
\item It's in your best interest to make the fixed cost investment in the new econometrics of DiD because the old methods are mostly harmful
\item Good news is we are at the conclusion of this wave of papers, software is now widely available, solutions tend to have common features, and overall presentations (static and dynamic) aren't all that different
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Concluding remarks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Simple 2x2 has its own problems when estimated using TWFE \emph{if you include covariates}
\item Stronger assumptions needed to include covariates, and bias can be large
\item Don't control for covariates that could be affected by the outcome 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Concluding remarks}

\begin{itemize}
\item Main problem in differential timing is heterogeneity and the use of already-treated units as controls
\item Differential timing and lacking a priori theory, you \emph{cannot} use TWFE.  It is biased, and it does not obey a ``no sign flip'' property, weights can be negative, etc etc.
\item Robust DiD methods do not place restrictions on treatment effect heterogeneity 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Concluding remarks}

\begin{itemize}
\item But when you lose parallel trends, you're probably going in the direction of needing synthetic control methods
\item There are plenty and they also require good form fit pre-treatment
\item But when you fail that, there are new advances -- augmented synth, Imbens and Doudchenko both allow for lower quality fit
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Thank you for coming to the workshop
\item I hope that this was valuable for you
\item We will be doing this until demand drops off, so keep your eyes peeled
\end{itemize}

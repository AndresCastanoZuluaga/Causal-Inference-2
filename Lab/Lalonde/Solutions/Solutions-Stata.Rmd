# Lalonde

This dataset is one of the most commonly used dataset in econometrics based on [Lalonde (1986)](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/aeaaecrev/v_3a76_3ay_3a1986_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a604-20.htm) and [Dehejia and Wahba (2002)](https://www.uh.edu/~adkugler/Dehejia&Wahba.pdf). Both the paper by Lalonde and Dehejia and Wahba both wanted to evaluate causal inference methods using non-experimental data. Cleverly, they start with an experimental dataset to estimate the 'true' causal effect and then use non-experimental data to evaluate an econometric method.

In [Causal Inference 1](github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Causal-Inference-1), we have already shown that the nonexperimental dataset performs poorly at estimating the effects of a job training program on earnings, finding a substantial negative effect. That lab shows that matching-based methods are effective at recovering effects close to the experimental effect. This lab will study difference-in-differences estimators of the effects.

1. We will first perform analysis on the experimental dataset `https://raw.github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Causal-Inference-2/master/Labs/Lalonde/lalonde_exp_panel.dta`

```{stata load-exp-data, , collectcode = TRUE}
* ssc install drdid, replace
clear
use "https://raw.github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Causal-Inference-2/master/Lab/Lalonde/lalonde_exp_panel.dta", clear 
```

a. As a reminder, perform a simple difference-in-means on the experimental dataset to estimate the "treatment effect". Use only the year `78` and compare average real earnings for the treated and the control groups. This is our baseline estimate of the treatment effect

```{stata difference-in-means-exp}
* Difference-in-means
reg re i.treat if year == 78, r
```

b. Estimate the effect of treatment, `treat`, on real-earnings, `re` in a difference-in-differences estimator. This will be the "true" treatment effect estimate that we will try to recreate with the non-experimental CPS sample. 

```{stata diff-in-diff-exp}
* Difference-in-differences
reghdfe re i.treat, absorb(id year) vce(robust)
```

2. Now, we turn to the non-experimental dataset `https://raw.github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Causal-Inference-2/master/Labs/Lalonde/lalonde_nonexp_panel.dta`. 

```{stata load-nonexp-data, collectcode = TRUE}
* 2. CPS data
use "https://raw.github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Causal-Inference-2/master/Lab/Lalonde/lalonde_nonexp_panel.dta", clear 
```

a. As a reminder, perform a simple difference-in-means on the combined dataset to estimate the "treatment effect". Use only the year `78` and compare average real earnings for the treated and the control groups.

```{stata difference-in-means-nonexp}
* Difference-in-means
reg re i.treat if year == 78, r
```

b. Estimate a difference-in-differences estimator for the non-experimental group.

```{stata diff-in-diff-nonexp}
* Initial Difference-in-difference
reghdfe re i.treat, absorb(id year) vce(robust)
```

c. Use the `DRDID` command to estimate a doubly-robust DID with covariates `age + agesq + agecube + educ + educsq + marr + nodegree + black + hisp`

```{stata drdid}
* Doubly-robust DID
drdid re age agesq agecube educ educsq marr nodegree black hisp re74 u74 if year == 75 | year == 78, time(year) ivar(id) tr(ever_treated)
```
